Put your answers in a text file in your replit folder and send the link to #twgss slack channel.

1. `a`, `b`, `c` are 3 integer variables whereas `a < b`. Write a boolean expression that determines whether `c` is between `a` and `b` (inclusive) **without** using the logical AND operator `&&`. <br>
In other words, write a boolean expression that is true if and only if `c` lies somewhere between `a` and `b` (inclusive).

### Boolean algebra
The following 4 equations can be derived from each other.
- `!(A || B) == !A && !B`
- `!(A && B) == !A || !B`
- `A || B == !(!A && !B)`
- `A && B == !(!A || !B)`

2. Which of the following boolean expressions are logically equivalent to `P AND (NOT (Q OR R))`? (you may choose none, one or more than one answers)<br>
i. `P AND ((NOT Q) AND (NOT R))`<br>
ii. `NOT ((NOT P) OR (Q OR R))`

3. Given a function `f` that takes the coordinates of two horizontal line segments as prameters, where:
    * line segment `a` connects two points `(ax1, ay)` and `(ax2, ay)` and it is guaranteed that `ax1 ≤ ax2`.
    * line segment `b` connects two points `(bx1, by)` and `(bx2, by)` and it is guaranteed that `bx1 ≤ bx2`.
    Complete `f` **WITHOUT** using any function calls, so that it returns `true` if and only if `a` and `b` share at least one point.
```cpp
bool f(int ay, int ax1, int ax2, 
       int by, int bx1, int bx2) {
    return _______A_______
}
```
`_____A_____` should be:

* Given another function `g` that takes the coordinates of a rectangle and a line segment as parameters, where:
    * rectange`a` has `(ax1, ay1)` as bottom-left vertex and `(ax2, ay2)` as top-right vertex. It is guaranteed that `ax1 ≤ ax2` and `ay1 ≤ ay2`.
    * line segment `b` connects two points `(bx1, by)` and `(bx2, by)` and it is guaranteed that `bx1 ≤ bx2`.
* Complete `g`, so that it returns `true` if and only if `a` and `b` share at least one point. You may use function `f` in function `g`.
```cpp
bool g(int ay1, int ay2, int ax1, int ax2,
       int by, int bx1, int bx2) {
    if (ay1 > by || ay2 < by)
        return false;
    else
        return _______B_______;
}
```
`_____B_____` should be:

4. Most Americans are confident. Most Americans are white. Therefore most white people are confident. Is this true (is this deduction logical)?

5. Most Americans are confident. Most confident people are welathy. Therefore most Americans are wealthy. Is this true (is this deduction logical)?

6. 80% of people in UK has a British accent. Most people in UK likes beer. Therefore at least 1/3 of people with a British accent likes beer.

7. 80% of people in UK has a British accent. Of all the people with a British accent in the world, only 10% are outside UK. Most people in UK likes beer. Therefore at least 1/3 of people with a British accent likes beer.

8. Suppose `a` and `b` are 32-bit signed integer variables (`int`) each storing a positive integer, which of the following expressions are equivalent to (i)? (you may choose none, one or more than one answers)
i. `a == b`
ii. `(a ^ b) == 0`
iii. `(a | b) == (a & b)`
iv. `(a + b) / 2 == a`

### `^` - XOR
- b is a boolean/bit (`0` or `1`)
- `1 ^ b` would "flip" the bit
- `0 ^ b` would keep it unchanged
9. What is `0^0^1^0^1^0`?
10. What about `0^0^1^0^1^1^0^0^1`?
11. What about `0^1^0^0^1^0^1^1^0^1^1^0^1`?
12. Complete the following program such that its output is `HKOI`.
```cpp
int a[10] = {1, 2, 12, 0, 58, 74, 64, 92, 58, 0};
int i, sum;
int main() {
    a[9] = _______C_______;
    sum = 0;
    for (i=0; i<10; i++)
        sum = sum ^ a[i];
    if (sum == 108)
        cout << "HKOI";
    return 0;
}
```
`_____C_____` should be:
